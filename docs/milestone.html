		<div class="content" align="center">
			We set out to create a model that realistically models, renders, and simulates cumulus cloud formation in an animation. Building onto the smoke simulations that were done in previous years, we want to apply that to cloud formation and motion. Our initial vision was to start from particles of water, and then simulate the condensation and scattering effects that result in what we see as clouds. In this method, our cloud formation would be a particle-based simulation adhering to physical principles such as the aforementioned condensation process of air to water vapor.
		</div>

		<div class="content" align="center">
			However, we decided for the sake of simplicity to move away from a totally physical approach and instead settled on a different model. Inspired by a 2000 paper from the University of Tokyo, we began implementing a loosely procedural model that operates under physical approximations. This paper proceeds through cloud generation in two major steps: simulation and rendering. For this milestone, we implement the first half, simulation.

		<div class="content" align="center">
			This paper uses three variables, each of which is determined procedurally for each voxel in a rendering space: the presence of a cloud (cld), the humidity (hum), and the phase transition (act) as a determination of whether a cloud is rendered or not in the voxel. These three variables are booleans and, while cloud starts as being FALSE for all of our voxels, the other two variables are assigned randomly. The relationships of these variables in a voxel at each time step eventually changes until we get to a completely rendered cloud. Graphically, when a voxel’s cloud boolean is true we turn it opaque, and when it isn’t we turn it totally transparent.
		</div>

		<div class="content" align="center">
			The relationships at each timestep between the three booleans is as follows:

		<div class="content" align="center">
			Of course, at this point we eventually hit a steady state we end up essentially with a completely cloud-filled space. As such we add the effects of advection and extinction. Extinction handles the problem that once cld is assigned 1, it never stops. This means that once a voxel becomes a cloud it never stops being a cloud. We implemented an extinction probability the animator can specify, which is the probability that any voxel with cld == TRUE turns to cld == FALSE. This allows for a continually evolving cloud shape to be rendered.
		</div>

		<div class="content" align="center">
			Advection refers to the effect of wind. We implemented a piecewise-linear function for wind velocity as a function of the z-coordinate. We write new transition rules for the three booleans now dependent on the booleans of the voxel some distance away as determined by the wind velocity. This gave us some neatly moving clouds, and had an especially nice effect when implemented alongside extinction.
		</div>

		<div class="content" align="center">
			In order to simulate a realistic shape for clouds, we use ellipsoids to govern areas where clouds are most likely to form. In the model, this just means parameters like cloud extinction and cloud reformation vary relative to the location of a certain point in the designated ellipsoid. For this milestone, we have assigned a single ellipsoid to the simulation space, but in the final submissions, we will generate more ellipsoids for a more realistic animation. 
		</div>

		<div class="content" align="center">
			So far, our progress has gone according to plan. In the first two weeks, we have created a simulation that governs the formation of a single, hard-coded cloud in our simulation space. Because we simplified our generation model away from a strictly physical-based one, most of our realism adjustments will occur near the end of the project after we have completed simulating the light sources. 
		</div>

		<div class="content" align="center">
			Moving forwards, we expect to spend the next week on completing the realistic lighting of clouds accounting for factors such as light scattering and absorption. Finally, once we have completed realistic lighting, we will adjust our cloud generation parameters to approximate the realistic animation of clouds. 
			If we have even more time, we may even try to implement a GUI that allows us to toggle the animator-input parameters in real time.
